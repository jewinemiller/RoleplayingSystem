# Core Rules

## Game Master
The **Game Master** or **GM** is the individual responsible for running a game in [SYSTEM]. As in most roleplaying systems, the GM's authority is considered **absolute**. It is encouraged to question the GM in the event that they are violating a core rule of [SYSTEM] or any modules in use, however the GM's ruling is **final** in all game-related manners.  

## Dice Rolling
The rules for dice rolling in [SYSTEM] are:

- All dice rolls are made with a 10-sided die (**d10**)
- Dice rolls for skills/actions are made against a **difficulty** which falls on a scale of **2-10** (More below)
- Dice rolls for skills/actions pass if they **meet or exceed** the difficulty level
- A roll of **1** is an automatic **failure**
- A roll of **10** is an automatic **success**

### Difficulty Levels
Any action in [SYSTEM] that takes more than a **mundane** amount of skill or luck requires that they player taking that action makes a skill check. The difficulty levels for skills/actions are:

| Difficulty | Level |  Description |
| :----------: | :---------: | :--------- |
| **2-3** | **Trivial** | Anyone can do this with little effort. Only the unlucky or otherwise hindered will fail. |
| **4-5** | **Difficult** | Requires some exertion or luck to accomplish. |
| **6-7** | **Very Difficult** | Very hard for the untrained to accomplish. Experts will not have much of a challenge. |
| **8-9** | **Extremely Difficult** | Even experts will have a tough time succeeding. Almost impossible for the inexperienced.|
| **10** | **Near-Impossible** | Only masters at this task or the very lucky will succeed. |

Read the [Skills](#skills) section below for more information about **skills** and their effect on gameplay.

> **Note:** Difficulty levels of 1 are not possible as a roll of 1 is an **automatic failure.** If something is a difficulty of 1 it should be considered a **mundane task.**

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some dice rolls in [SYSTEM] will be made with **advantage** or **disadvantage**.
- Rolls made with **advantage** roll **3d10** and take the **highest** value as their roll.
- Rolls with **disadvantage** roll **3d10** and take the **lowest** value as their roll.

Several factors can determine if a roll is made with advantage or disadvantage and how many dice are rolled. These factors are generally up to the GM, but can be:

#### Advantage
- If a character has been augmented in their abilities or skills.
- Magical, technological, or divine intervention.

#### Disadvantage
- If the character has been physically restrained or otherwise disabled.
- If a character has been cursed, charmed, or otherwise rendered mentally incapacitated.

Players or non-player characters can also use abilities on their companions or enemies that grant **advantage** or **disadvantage** depending on the ability's effect(s).

Additionally, advantage and disadvantage **cancel out**, meaning that a player that would normally have **advantage** but has now been given **disadvantage** rolls **1d10** as if no effects are present.

> **Note:** Some abilities can overcome this cancelling-out effect and force a player to roll with **advantage** or **disadvantage** regardless of the situation. Follow the standard rules above unless the ability states that it's affects **overcome** advantage or disadvantage.

## Skills
**Skills** represent a character's ability to perform an action that requires more than a mundane amount of effort or luck. Additionally, **skills** represent a character's ability to overcome, resist, or avoid effects from abilities or traits of other characters or enemies in-game. Skills are generally used in one of three ways: **contests**, **checks**, and **saves**.

[SYSTEM] does not define any set skills for players to use. Instead, **any** action can be the target of a **skill check, save, or contest.**

For example, a thief who is trying to pass as a famous chef in order to gain entry into the King's banquet hall may have to roll a **deception contest** with the guard at the door to see if they can lie about their identity. Assuming the thief passes, they may be escorted into the kitchen in order to cook the King's meal. The thief would then have to roll a **cooking check** to see if they can successfully make a meal as cooking like a professional chef requires an exceptional amount of skill.

### Skill Checks

Skill checks are, by far, the most common way to use skills in regular play. Skill checks are used when attempting to perform any action in-game that requires any talent or luck to accomplish. Skill checks are given a **difficulty level** as detailed in the section on [Difficulty Levels](#difficulty-levels).

### Skill Saves

Certain abilities, attacks, or actions require that the target of the action attempts to resist or avoid its effects. These actions will specify a **difficulty** and an effect if the character **fails** the save.

### Skill Contests

### Advantage and Disadvantage

As mentioned in the [Dice Rolling](#dice-rolling) section, skills can be rolled with **advantage** or **disadvantage**.

**Advantage** is commonly granted by character **traits** or **abilities** and is often targeted at a specific type of skill check, save, or contest. Some examples of this include:
- Body augmentations that grant a character **advantage** when trying to jump, run, or climb.
- Mental training that grants a character **advantage** when trying to resist psychic attacks.
- An item that allows a character to roll with **advantage** when trying to physically restrain other characters (such as when grappling or wrestling).

**Disadvantage** is commonly granted by character **flaws** or other effects/conditions that would hinder the character from performing their skills. Some examples of this include:
- A character that has taken a vow of silence, giving them **disadvantage** on any attempts to persuade, lie, or otherwise communicate with other characters.  
- A character and their party have been locked in irons and imprisoned. The character's escape attempts are made with **disadvantage** due to the restraint.
- Two characters are locked into a magical duel. One character has a **trait** that interferes with their opponents' magic. The opponent rolls all **contests** with **disadvantage**.

Not all rolls are made with advantage and disadvantage and when they should be applied is left to the determination of the GM. Granting advantage and disadvantage should be done at logical times. For example, a player who has an ability granting advantage on skill checks related to understanding alien technology should **not** be given advantage on a check to fly an alien ship just because it uses that technology. They **should**, however, be given advantage when attempting to decipher the controls and relay their purpose to another character who would have **advantage** flying the ship.

### Unconsciousness
Characters that are unconscious or otherwise **incapacitated** are considered to have automatically failed any skill checks unless stated otherwise.

## Characters
Each player in a [SYSTEM] session controls a character. This character is the representation of the player in the game world. Characters in the core rules of [SYSTEM] are intentionally lightweight and designed to serve as a framework for any extensions to [SYSTEM] build upon.

### Creating a Character
Characters in [SYSTEM] are all created equally (at first). All characters should be created with the same base properties:

- Name
- Age
- Physical Description
- Customization Points

A player creating a character should define their character's **Name, Age, and Physical Description**. Their character's **Customization Points** will be determined by the GM and the campaign/session difficulty.

Depending on the game world and module(s) used, characters can be created in any number of races, religions, species, etc. that provide additional character **traits** or **abilities**. When this is the case, refer to the rules of that game world or module for any additional steps or notes about character creation.

Additionally, the module(s) or game world in use may define a base set of character **traits** or **abilities** to apply during character creation. Refer to the game world or module in use for these rules and follow their additional steps for character creation.

### Customization Points

At the start of character creation, a GM can grant every player a number of customization points to use to assign **traits** or **abilities** to their characters. Players can choose any number of **traits** or **abilities** for their characters as long as they have enough customization points and/or any prerequisites required by the **trait** or **ability**.

Players can also assign **flaws** to their characters which grant them a number of additional points that they can use for customization. The number of points that can be gained from taking **flaws** is limited to **half** of the number of assigned customization points (rounded down).

### Traits, Abilities, and Flaws
A major component to any character in [SYSTEM] are the traits abilities that their character has at hand.

### Death and Incapacitation
Characters in [SYSTEM] can, and will, die or become permanently incapacitated at some point. The rules for death and permanent incapacitation are:
- Characters can have a statistic or statistics that represent their potential to die or become incapacitated (hit points, sanity, drunkenness, etc.)
- Actions in the game world, such as getting attacked in combat, can **raise or lower** these statistic(s).
- Each statistic is granted a **threshold** for when it triggers death or permanent incapacitation.
- When these statistic(s) reach this threshold, the player is forced to make an **endurance check** to determine if the character is killed/permanently incapacitated or not.
- An **endurance check** is a roll of **1d10** with a difficulty of **5**. If the player succeeds, their character becomes **temporarily incapacitated**.
- **Temporarily Incapacitated** characters can take no actions during their turn and are considered **unconscious** for all skill and ability checks.
- **Temporarily Incapacitated** characters can be revived by their companions. Reviving a character has a difficulty of **5** and takes a **Primary Action**. A revived character becomes conscious and is **1 point** from the incapacitation threshold.
- Any action or effect that would cause a character to go beyond the threshold when they are **Temporarily Incapacitated** triggers another **endurance check**.
- If a character starts their turn **temporarily incapacitated** they must make another **endurance check** to determine if they become **permanently incapacitated** or **dead**.
- A character being healed or otherwise revived through another character's ability or effect immediately cancels their **temporary incapacitation**.

Some examples of these rules in action are:

- A warrior is in combat with an ogre. The warrior has **10 health** remaining. The ogre swings its club at the warrior and hits for **11 damage**. The warrior's health is below the **threshold** of 0, so she falls to the blow. The warrior's player makes an **endurance check** and rolls a **3**. Since this is less than **5**, the warrior succumbs to the ogre's damage and dies.

- A bard is on an epic pub crawl with some of his bard friends and has had too much to drink. He is at **9 Drunkenness** before downing another pint of ale, bringing him to **10**, which is the **threshold** for passing out (and ending his night). The bard's player makes an **endurance check** and rolls a **7**. The bard is only **temporarily incapacitated** and his bard friends manage to shake him awake a few minutes later. He wakes a little bit sobered up from his nap and is back to **9 Drunkenness**.

> **Note:** The rules for incapacitation and death should **always** apply to player characters, but can conditionally apply to non-player characters at GM discretion.

#### Resurrection/Recovery
Resurrection or recovery from permanent incapacitation is not always guaranteed, but is possible in certain settings or circumstances. Whether resurrection or recovery from permanent incapacitation is possible is up to the **GM** and/or the **module/setting** in use.

## Actions
In [SYSTEM] characters take turns performing actions which can affect themselves, each other, or anything inhabiting the game world. Each turn that a character takes is broken down into three categories: **Primary Actions**, **Secondary Actions**, and **Reactions**.  

**Primary Actions** are actions which take a significant amount of time to complete and which have a large impact on the character's immediate surroundings. A character only has **one** primary action per turn. Examples of primary actions are attacking an enemy, casting a spell, or using most combat abilities.

**Secondary Actions** are actions which take little to no time or effort to complete and which have limited impact to the character's surroundings. These can include actions such as shouting a message to another character, taunting an enemy, or switching weapons. A character only has **one** secondary action per turn.

**Reactions** are actions which are performed by a character instantly in response to the actions of another character. Characters can have **one** reaction per turn. Character abilities and actions will specify when they provide the opportunity for a reaction to take place.

> **Note:** The action system is primarily intended to be used when turn-based play is required (For example, in combat). Most normal roleplaying will be more freeform and allow characters to take any actions they want (within GM discretion).

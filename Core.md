# Core Rules

## Game Master
The **Game Master** or **GM** is the individual responsible for running a game in [SYSTEM]. As in most roleplaying systems, the GM's authority is considered **absolute**. It is encouraged to question the GM in the event that they are violating a core rule of [SYSTEM] or any modules in use, however the GM's ruling is **final** in all game-related manners.  

## Dice Rolling
The rules for dice rolling in [SYSTEM] are:

- All dice rolls are made with a 10-sided die (**d10**)
- Dice rolls for skills/actions are made against a **difficulty** which falls on a scale of **2-10** (More below)
- Dice rolls for skills/actions pass if they **meet or exceed** the difficulty level
- A roll of **1** is an automatic **failure**
- A roll of **10** is an automatic **success**

### Difficulty Levels
Any action in [SYSTEM] that takes more than a **mundane** amount of skill or luck requires that they player taking that action makes a skill check. The difficulty levels for skills/actions are:

| Difficulty | Level |  Description |
| :----------: | :---------: | :--------- |
| **2-3** | **Trivial** | Anyone can do this with little effort. Only the unlucky or otherwise hindered will fail. |
| **4-5** | **Difficult** | Requires some exertion or luck to accomplish. |
| **6-7** | **Very Difficult** | Very hard for the untrained to accomplish. Experts will not have much of a challenge. |
| **8-9** | **Extremely Difficult** | Even experts will have a tough time succeeding. Almost impossible for the inexperienced.|
| **10** | **Near-Impossible** | Only masters at this task or the lucky will succeed. |

> **Note:** Difficulty levels of 1 are not possible as a roll of 1 is an **automatic failure.** If something is a difficulty of 1 it should be considered a **mundane task.**

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some dice rolls in [SYSTEM] will be made with **advantage** or **disadvantage**.
- Rolls made with **advantage** roll the specified number of **d10s** and take the **highest** value as their roll.
- Rolls with **disadvantage** roll the specified number of **d10s** and take the **lowest** value as their roll.

Advantage and disadvantage are denoted as a number of **additional** dice to roll. For example:

- Rolling at **1d10 advantage** means that a player rolls **2d10** (1d10 normal + 1d10 advantage) and takes the **highest** value.
- Rolling at **2d10 disadvantage** means that a player rolls **3d10** (1d10 normal + 2d10 disadvantage) and takes the **lowest** value.

Several factors can determine if a roll is made with advantage or disadvantage and how many dice are rolled. These factors are generally up to the GM, but can be:

- A character's proficiency in an action. See the **[Skills & Abilities](#skills-and-abilities)** section for more information.
- If the character has been physically restrained or otherwise disabled.
- If a character has been augmented in their abilities or skills.
- Magical, technological, or divine intervention.
- A character's physical or mental status.
- Effects from any actions or abilities targeted at the player.
- Effects another player or in-game entity has on the rolling player.

Additionally, advantage and disadvantage **cancel out**. Each die of advantage cancels out a corresponding die of disadvantage and vice-versa. Some examples of this are:

- A character that is skilled at fighting (1d10 advantage) but who has been forced to fight with their off-hand (1d10 disadvantage). In this case they would roll **1d10** to perform any combat-based actions.
- A character is an expert at escaping prison (3d10 advantage) but has had their hands tied (1d10 disadvantage). In this case they would roll at **2d10 advantage** to attempt to escape from a prison while their hands are tied.

## Characters
Each player in a [SYSTEM] session controls a character. This character is the representation of the player in the game world. Characters in the core rules of [SYSTEM] are intentionally lightweight and designed to serve as a framework for any extensions to [SYSTEM] build upon.

### Creating a Character
Characters in [SYSTEM] are all created equally (at first). All characters should be created with the same base properties:

- Name
- Age
- Physical Description
- Experience Level

A player creating a character should define their character's **Name, Age, and Physical Description**. Their character's **Experience Level** will be determined by the GM and the campaign/session difficulty.

Depending on the game world and module(s) used, characters can be created in any number of races, religions, species, etc. that provide additional bonuses or character abilities. When this is the case, refer to the rules of that game world or module for any additional steps or notes about character creation.

Additionally, the module(s) or game world in use may define a base set of character traits or abilities to apply during character creation. Refer to the game world or module in use for these rules and follow their additional steps for character creation.

### Experience Level

Characters in [SYSTEM] have an inherent experience level, from **Untrained** to **Legendary**, tied to them. This level depicts how powerful, experienced, and effective they are within the game world. Experience Level directly affects all aspects of a character including their combat effectiveness, abilities/skills, health/physical characteristics, etc.

One important factor of experience level is a character's **Proficiencies** and **Advantage**. **Proficiencies** are skills or abilities that a character is well practiced at and able to do with an exceptional amount of skill. Characters can tag skills as **proficient** which gives them **advantage** on rolls with those skills. As a character reaches higher experience levels, their advantage for proficient skills increases, representing their increased ability to perform tasks that they are increasingly better trained in.

A character's level is determined by the amount of in-world experience they possess when compared to the average person. Characters can advance in experience level as they perform more actions in the game world. As a character's experience level climbs, the amount of effort they have to put in to advance further increases, often exponentially.

| Experience Level | Description | Example | Proficiencies | Advantage |
| :--------- | :---------- | :------ | :------: | :---------: |
| **Untrained** | An average person with few, if any, special abilities. | Town Member | 0 | - |
| **Apprentice** | A character who has undergone some basic level of training. A novice in their chosen field. | Wizard's Apprentice | 2 | 1d10 |
| **Trained** | A character who has completed their training and is thought to be adept at their chosen field. | Professional Soldier | 3 | 2d10 |
| **Expert** | A character who has gone beyond normal training and has begun to master advanced techniques or teachings in their field. | Mercenary Captain | 5 | 3d10 |
| **Master** | A character who has mastered everything commonly known or practiced in their field (and many things that are not common knowledge). | Thieves Guild Leader | 8 | 4d10 |
| **Legendary** | A character who is nearly without equal. Their deeds are what legends are made from. | Godslayer | 13 | 5d10 |

[SYSTEM] does not define a set amount of experience points or numerical levels to assign to characters. Instead, the experience levels provided serve as a guide to determine how powerful characters should be.

> **Note:** Characters do not have to start a campaign or session at a low experience level. Character level is flexible and players should create characters at a level deemed appropriate for the challenge of the campaign or session.

### Physical and Mental Status
Characters can be given modifications to their physical or mental status. These modifications can be permanent or temporary and may confer various effects including providing advantages or disadvantages to certain abilities or skill checks. Physical or mental statuses can be assigned during character creation at GM discretion and can be added to characters at any time as a result of their actions in the game world. Some examples of physical or mental statuses are:

-  Phobias or anxiety that grant disadvantage when making related checks (Swimming across a lake when a character is scared of deep water).
- Physical augmentations that provide advantage to related checks (Bionic eyes that enable the character to see in much greater detail).
- Temporary paralysis that stops a character from moving or interacting with the game world.

### Death and Incapacitation
Characters in [SYSTEM] can, and will, die or become permanently incapacitated at some point. The rules for death and permanent incapacitation are:
- Characters can have a statistic or statistics that represent their potential to die or become incapacitated (hit points, sanity, drunkenness, etc.)
- Actions in the game world, such as getting attacked in combat, can **raise or lower** these statistic(s).
- Each statistic is granted a **threshold** for when it triggers death or permanent incapacitation.
- When these statistic(s) reach this threshold, the player is forced to make an **endurance check** to determine if the character is killed/permanently incapacitated or not.
- An **endurance check** is a roll of **1d10** with a difficulty of **5**. If the player succeeds, their character becomes **temporarily incapacitated**.
- **Temporarily Incapacitated** characters can take no actions during their turn and are considered **unconscious** for all skill and ability checks.
- **Temporarily Incapacitated** characters can be revived by their companions. Reviving a character has a difficulty of **5** and takes a **Primary Action**. A revived character becomes conscious and is **1 point** from the incapacitation threshold.
- Any action or effect that would cause a character to go beyond the threshold when they are **Temporarily Incapacitated** triggers another **endurance check**.
- If a character starts their turn **temporarily incapacitated** they must make another **endurance check** to determine if they become **permanently incapacitated** or **dead**.
- A character being healed or otherwise revived through another character's ability or effect immediately cancels their **temporary incapacitation**.

Some examples of these rules in action are:

- A warrior is in combat with an ogre. The warrior has **10 health** remaining. The ogre swings its club at the warrior and hits for **11 damage**. The warrior's health is below the **threshold** of 0, so she falls to the blow. The warrior's player makes an **endurance check** and rolls a **3**. Since this is less than **5**, the warrior succumbs to the ogre's damage and dies.

- A bard is on an epic pub crawl with some of his bard friends and has had too much to drink. He is at **9 Drunkenness** before downing another pint of ale, bringing him to **10**, which is the **threshold** for passing out (and ending his night). The bard's player makes an **endurance check** and rolls a **7**. The bard is only **temporarily incapacitated** and his bard friends manage to shake him awake a few minutes later. He comes to a little bit sobered up from his nap and is back to **9 Drunkenness**.

- A street fighter is in a brawl with five opponents. He has been hit too many times and falls unconscious with **0 health**. The player rolls a **9** on their **endurance check** and he's **temporarily incapacitated**. The thugs that knocked him out keep kicking him while he's down and the player is forced to make another **endurance check** for each kick. They succeed on two of them, but on the third kick they roll a **2** and the street fighter is killed.

> **Note:** The rules for incapacitation and death should **always** apply to player characters, but can conditionally apply to non-player characters at GM discretion.

## Skills and Abilities
A major component to any character in [SYSTEM] is the skills and abilities that their experience brings to a party. MORE TEXT

#### Proficiency

As a character becomes more experienced, they gain a proficiency with certain skills and abilities. Proficiencies are granted per experience level and add a number of advantage dice specified on the table in the **[Experience Level](#experience-level)** section above. The important part of that table is:

| Experience Level | Proficiencies | Advantage |
| :--------------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
| Untrained | 0 | - |
| Apprentice | 2 | 1d10 |
| Trained | 3 | 2d10 |
| Expert | 5 | 3d10 |
| Master | 8 | 4d10 |
| Legendary | 13 | 5d10 |

#### Disadvantage

In some situations, a character may be at a disadvantage when trying to perform a skill or action. In this case, they are hampered from success and must roll the specified number of d10s and take the **lowest** value rolled. The table below describes the levels of disadvantage and their effect on the character:

| Penalty Level | Disadvantage | Description |
| :-----------: | :----------: | :---------- |
| Minor     | 1d10 | A minor inconvenience that would only hurt an average person. |
| Major     | 2d10 | A major inconvenience that challenges even the well trained. |
| Severe    | 3d10 | A near-total prevention of success. |
| Crippling | 4d10 | An inconvenience that would render a task almost totally impossible for anybody. |

#### Custom Skills

Many modules will define custom skills and abilities to apply to characters. Please refer to the module or modules for information about what custom skills and abilities are available and how they can be used during a campaign or session.

#### Unconsciousness
Characters that are unconscious or otherwise **incapacitated** are considered to have automatically failed any skill or ability checks unless stated otherwise.

## Actions
In [SYSTEM] characters take turns performing actions which can affect themselves, each other, or anything inhabiting the game world. Each turn that a character takes is broken down into three categories: **Primary Actions**, **Secondary Actions**, and **Reactions**.  

**Primary Actions** are actions which take a significant amount of time to complete and which have a large impact on the character's immediate surroundings. A character only has **one** primary action per turn. Examples of primary actions are attacking an enemy, casting a spell, or using most combat abilities.

**Secondary Actions** are actions which take little to no time or effort to complete and which have limited impact to the character's surroundings. These can include actions such as shouting a message to another character, taunting an enemy, or switching weapons. A character only has **one** secondary action per turn.

**Reactions** are actions which are performed by a character instantly in response to the actions of another character. Characters can have **one** reaction per turn. Character abilities and actions will specify when they provide the opportunity for a reaction to take place.

> **Note:** The action system is primarily intended to be used when turn-based play is required (For example, in combat). Most normal roleplaying will be more freeform and allow characters to take any actions they want (within GM discretion).
